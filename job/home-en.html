<h1>Minteck Projects job tracker</h1>
<p>Mainly made for developers, the Minteck Projects job tracker helps monitor ProjectsRendR render processes activity.</p>
<p>ProjectsRendR is the rendering engine, based on PHP, that Minteck Projects' websites powered by the Polymer 3 update uses. It helps developers with hard work and help them focus only on content.</p>
<p>You won't risk anything in sharing render thread identifiers, since they don't contain your personal information.</p>

<h2>How to access a job trace?</h2>
<p>First, go to a page which ProjectsRendR made the rendering. Then, search a discreet « Job# » message at the bottom of the page. Finally, click on it.</p>
<p>You can't manually enter a thread identifier because each render process (which means each page visit) have a unique identifier.</p>

<h2>What contains job traces?</h2>
<p>Job traces only contain info that helps debugging the rendering engine or the source code. As mentioned earlier, they don't contain you personal information. Typically collected infos are info about server process, how long the rendering took, and info about software versions.</p>
